# Welcome to Math 101
Math101 is a very difficult course. It involves
- thinking
- pinking
- sinking
- and rinking

## Notes
You might even need to use some Python!
```python
def fib(n):
  if n == 0 or n == 1: return n
  return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2)
```
Can't wait to get started? Try solving this question:
???
Question: If $x^2+1=2$, what is $x$?
[x] +1
[ ] $\sqrt(2)$
[x] -1
[ ] 2

Explanation:
$x^2=2-1=1$, so $x$ has two solutions: $-1$ and $1$.
???

We hope you have fun!
